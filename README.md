# Ganna Sachkova Portfolio
Stream One Project: Interactive Front End Development with Javascript - Code Institute 

I created a website that calls on the Google Maps API to allow users to search for their next holiday destination. This site will help our users:
Select a destination city
Find tourist attractions
Find accommodation
Find bars and restaurants and so on.
I provide search results in a manner that is visually appealing for website users. 

## Demo
A live demo can be found [here](https://gannasachkova.github.io/project-2-google-map/).

## UX
My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access information on the site while striving for a minimalist design. The bright colour scheme was chosen to create a sleek and modern feel.

For users, I wanted to provide them with a brief overview of “Athlone” town and its services via a user-friendly design. This way, they would be able to get a glimpse of it has, Accommodations, Restaurants/Bars, and Entertainment.

## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.3.1)
4. JavaScript
5. jQuery

## Features
This project contains the zoom, grab and drag features to help navigate through the map.

### It remains to implement
In the future, I would like to add all of Ireland cities/towns into the site with all of the attractions. I also would like to add the pictures and site link to each of the attractions to the info windows.  

## Testing
During vacations or weekend, most people prefer to travel by car through the country to discover new places or cities. Our website “EasyWayHoliday” can help them to find many interesting and attractive destinations quickly and easily. 
People can manage website features easily.  It has only a few options: 
1. Select the city/town
2 Select necessary: accommodation, entertainment or restaurants/bars.
As result, our visitors can see on the map their requirements with the help of the icons. Each icon has a pop-up window that has a short description of the chosen place: name of the selected place. In future, I will add to the InfoWindow extra information: picture, rating and a link to their website.  
As well as that this site was tested across multiple browsers and on multiple mobile devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.
## Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named index.html.
To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting [git clone](https://github.com/GannaSachkova/project-2-google-map.git) into your terminal. To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type git remote rm origin into the terminal.
